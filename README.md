# Machine Learning Benchmark

This is the project from our DBPRO SS19 course. The goal of this project is to measure the performance of 9 machine learning algorithms on multi-class image recognition (classification) regarding the **accuracy** and **speed**. The benchmarking process is based on Pirotti et. al.'s paper [1] . The dataset we used is the [EuroSAT Dataset (RGB)](https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT).

### Machine Learning Algorithms benchmarked in this program:
  * Linear Discriminant Analysis (lda)
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (knn)
  * Randome Forest (randomForest)
  * Support Vector Machine (svm)
  * Multi-Layer Perceptron (mlp)
  * Multi-Layer Perceptron Ensembled (mlpe)
  * Decision Tree (dtree)
  * Adaptive Boosting (boosting)
  * Logistic Regression (lr)

### Accuracy Indices used in this program:
* Classification Accuracy Rate (ACC)
* Balanced Error Rate (BER)
* Classification Error Rate (CE)
* CREAMER'S V (CREAMERV)
* Cohen's kappa index (KAPPA)

## Run the program

  

To run the benchmark program, you need to download and unzip the EuroSAT Dataset (RGB) from https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT.

  

### Prerequisites

  

To run the program, you need:


1. Python version: 3.6+
2. Libraries: numpy, sci-kit learn, matplotlib, PILLOW
  

### Running the benchmark

  


1. Open `main.py`, in line 85, set the `path=[path of the unzipped folder]` . (More info see the documentation in main() function)
2. Run `main.py`


## Sample Results
1. Training accuracy of models trained on different size of data.
